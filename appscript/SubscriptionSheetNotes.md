# Validating Subscription Fields

---

## Campaign

A dropdown box has been set which links to the Campaigns sheet. This ensures
that the user cannot select something that doesn't exist. We can outright
reject this input making sure the user must select a valid campaign.

The user may choose to manually enter characters, but if the campaign does
not exist, the user cannot proceed.

## User

The same dropdown box that applies for Campaign applies here is well.
